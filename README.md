# Hey ğŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository.
#### Invite my bot to your server - https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1066394215107543061&permissions=8&scope=bot.
#### This is a multitasking bot.
#### You can use it for both fun and moderating.
#### I will be adding more moderating and entertaining commands so stay close to my repository and follow me on GitHub.
