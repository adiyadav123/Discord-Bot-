<h1>Hey ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my repository</h1>
<p>Here is my bot's full code</p>
<p>It's free to use and open source</p>
<p>I will be updating some things and adding some more features to my bot. So stay tuned</p>
<h1>How to use?</h1>
<p>If you are a beginner so you need this help!</p><br>
<p>1. Copy the url of repository and open your terminal in any folder where you want to put my bot's files</p>
2. Type ```git clone repo_url```
3. Then open the folder in any code editor
4. Then search ```config.json``` file.
5. Put your credentials there. Like for example ```{ 
"token":"zujfxbdkehkuebu_wrwdhsabxc"
}```
6. After that you can change the bot's name and profile picture in ```index.js``` file.
7. If you don't know how to do so copy and paste this code on line "30". ```client.user.setUsername('username');```
8. And if you want to change the Avatar of the bot. So paste this code just below it. ```client.user.setAvatar('URL or path');```
<h1>If you want any help regarding this or api keys so feel free to contact me on discord.</h1>
